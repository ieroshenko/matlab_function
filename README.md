# matlab_function

updateArray.c is a matlab function, which I wrote in C for TMS_modeling toolbox project: https://github.com/TMSCoreLab/Software-Toolkit-for-TMS-Modeling-with-Boundary-Element-Fast-Multipole-Method

The function basically performs necessary calculations with arrays that have a big number of entrees.

The main purpose of writing the function was to significanlty increases the calculation speed compared to the similar function but written in Matlab code.
